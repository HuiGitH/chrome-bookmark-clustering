We were just beginning to run up against the limits of our\u000amonolithic, centralized database and needed to start the transition to\u000aa portfolio of specialized distributed systems. This has been an\u000ainteresting experience: we built, deployed, and run to this day a\u000adistributed graph database, a distributed search backend, a Hadoop\u000ainstallation, and a first and second generation key-value store. </p>\u000a<p> One of the most useful things I learned in all this was that many of\u000athe things we were building had a very simple concept at their heart:\u000athe log. Sometimes called write-ahead logs or commit logs or\u000atransaction logs, logs have been around almost as long as computers\u000aand are at the heart of many distributed data systems and real-time\u000aapplication architectures. </p>\u000a<p> You can't fully understand databases, NoSQL stores, key value\u000astores, replication, paxos, hadoop, version control, or almost any\u000asoftware system without understanding logs; and yet, most software\u000aengineers are not familiar with them. I'd like to change that. In this\u000apost, I'll walk you through everything you need to know about logs,\u000aincluding what is log and how to use logs for data integration, real\u000atime processing, and system building. </p>\u000a<h2>Part One: What Is a Log?</h2>\u000aA log is perhaps the simplest possible storage abstraction. It is an\u000aappend-only, totally-ordered sequence of records ordered by time. It\u000alooks like this: <div>\u000a<img src="https://content.linkedin.com/content/dam/engineering/en-us/blog/migrated/log.png" style="width: 50.0%;" pagespeed_url_hash="398426766" onload="pagespeed.CriticalImages.checkImageForCriticality(this);">\u000a</div>\u000a<p> Records are appended to the end of the log, and reads proceed\u000aleft-to-right. Each entry is assigned a unique sequential log entry\u000anumber. </p>\u000a<p> The ordering of records defines a notion of &quot;time&quot; since\u000aentries to the left are defined to be older then entries to the right.\u000aThe log entry number can be thought of as the &quot;timestamp&quot; of\u000athe entry. Describing this ordering as a notion of time seems a bit\u000aodd at first, but it has the convenient property that it is decoupled\u000afrom any particular physical clock. This property will turn out to be\u000aessential as we get to distributed systems. </p>\u000a<p> The contents and format of the records aren't important for the\u000apurposes of this discussion. Also, we can't just keep adding records\u000ato the log as we'll eventually run out of space. I'll come back to\u000athis in a bit. </p>\u000a<p> So, a log is not all that different from a file or a table. A file\u000ais an array of bytes, a table is an array of records, and a log is\u000areally just a kind of table or file where the records are sorted by\u000atime. </p>\u000a<p> At this point you might be wondering why it is worth talking about\u000asomething so simple? How is a append-only sequence of records in any\u000away related to data systems? The answer is that logs have a specific\u000apurpose: they record what happened and when. For distributed data\u000asystems this is, in many ways, the very heart of the problem. </p>\u000a<p> But before we get too far let me clarify something that is a bit\u000aconfusing. Every programmer is familiar with another definition of\u000alogging\u2014the unstructured error messages or trace info an application\u000amight write out to a local file using syslog or log4j. For clarity I\u000awill call this &quot;application logging&quot;. The application log is\u000aa degenerative form of the log concept I am describing. The biggest\u000adifference is that text logs are meant to be primarily for humans to\u000aread and the &quot;journal&quot; or &quot;data logs&quot; I'm\u000adescribing are built for programmatic access. </p>\u000a<p> (Actually, if you think about it, the idea of humans reading through\u000alogs on individual machines is something of an anachronism. This\u000aapproach quickly becomes an unmanageable strategy when many services\u000aand servers are involved and the purpose of logs quickly becomes as an\u000ainput to queries and graphs to understand behavior across many\u000amachines\u2014something for which english text in files is not nearly as\u000aappropriate as the kind structured log described here.) </p>\u000a<h3>Logs in databases</h3>\u000a<p> I don't know where the log concept originated\u2014probably it is one of\u000athose things like binary search that is too simple for the inventor to\u000arealize it was an invention. It is present as early as IBM's <a href="http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~brewer/cs262/SystemR.pdf" target="_blank">System R</a>. The usage in databases has to do with\u000akeeping in sync the variety of data structures and indexes in the\u000apresence of crashes. To make this atomic and durable, a database uses\u000aa log to write out information about the records they will be\u000amodifying, before applying the changes to all the various data\u000astructures it maintains. The log is the record of what happened, and\u000aeach table or index is a projection of this history into some useful\u000adata structure or index. Since the log is immediately persisted it is\u000aused as the authoritative source in restoring all other persistent\u000astructures in the event of a crash. </p>\u000a<p> Over-time the usage of the log grew from an implementation detail of\u000aACID to a method for replicating data between databases. It turns out\u000athat the sequence of changes that happened on the database is exactly\u000awhat is needed to keep a remote replica database in sync. Oracle,\u000aMySQL, and PostgreSQL include log shipping protocols to transmit\u000aportions of log to replica databases which act as slaves. Oracle has\u000aproductized the log as a general data subscription mechanism for\u000anon-oracle data subscribers with their <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/cd/E11882_01/server.112/e16545/xstrm_intro.htm" target="_blank">XStreams</a> and <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/middleware/goldengate/overview/index.html" target="_blank">GoldenGate</a> and similar facilities in MySQL and\u000aPostgreSQL are key components of many data architectures. </p>\u000a<p> Because of this origin, the concept of a machine readable log has\u000alargely been confined to database internals. The use of logs as a\u000amechanism for data subscription seems to have arisen almost by chance.\u000aBut this very abstraction is ideal for supporting all kinds of\u000amessaging, data flow, and real-time data processing. </p>\u000a<h3>Logs in distributed systems</h3>\u000a<p> The two problems a log solves\u2014ordering changes and distributing\u000adata\u2014are even more important in distributed data systems. Agreeing\u000aupon an ordering for updates (or agreeing to disagree and coping with\u000athe side-effects) are among the core design problems for these\u000asystems. </p>\u000a<p> The log-centric approach to distributed systems arises from a simple\u000aobservation that I will call the State Machine Replication Principle: </p>\u000a<div> If two identical, deterministic processes begin in the same state\u000aand get the same inputs in the same order, they will produce the same\u000aoutput and end in the same state. </div>\u000a<p> This may seem a bit obtuse, so let's dive in and understand what it\u000ameans. </p>\u000a<p>\u000a<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deterministic_algorithm" target="_blank">Deterministic</a> means that the processing isn't\u000atiming dependent and doesn't let any other &quot;out of band&quot;\u000ainput influence its results. For example a program whose output is\u000ainfluenced by the particular order of execution of threads or by a\u000acall to <code>gettimeofday</code> or some other non-repeatable thing\u000ais generally best considered as non-deterministic. </p>\u000a<p> The <i>state</i> of the process is whatever data remains on the\u000amachine, either in memory or on disk, at the end of the processing. </p>\u000a<p> The bit about getting the same input in the same order should ring a\u000abell\u2014that is where the log comes in. This is a very intuitive notion:\u000aif you feed two deterministic pieces of code the same input log, they\u000awill produce the same output. </p>\u000a<p> The application to distributed computing is pretty obvious. You can\u000areduce the problem of making multiple machines all do the same thing\u000ato the problem of implementing a distributed consistent log to feed\u000athese processes input. The purpose of the log here is to squeeze all\u000athe non-determinism out of the input stream to ensure that each\u000areplica processing this input stays in sync. </p>\u000a<p> When you understand it, there is nothing complicated or deep about\u000athis principle: it more or less amounts to saying &quot;deterministic\u000aprocessing is deterministic&quot;. Nonetheless, I think it is one of\u000athe more general tools for distributed systems design. </p>\u000a<p> One of the beautiful things about this approach is that the time\u000astamps that index the log now act as the clock for the state of the\u000areplicas\u2014you can describe each replica by a single number, the\u000atimestamp for the maximum log entry it has processed. This timestamp\u000acombined with the log uniquely captures the entire state of the\u000areplica. </p>\u000a<p> There are a multitude of ways of applying this principle in systems\u000adepending on what is put in the log. For example, we can log the\u000aincoming requests to a service, or the state changes the service\u000aundergoes in response to request, or the transformation commands it\u000aexecutes. Theoretically, we could even log a series of machine\u000ainstructions for each replica to execute or the method name and\u000aarguments to invoke on each replica. As long as two processes process\u000athese inputs in the same way, the processes will remaining consistent\u000aacross replicas. </p>\u000a<p> Different groups of people seem to describe the uses of logs\u000adifferently. Database people generally differentiate between\u000a<i>physical</i> and <i>logical</i> logging. Physical logging means\u000alogging the contents of each row that is changed. Logical logging\u000ameans logging not the changed rows but the SQL commands that lead to\u000athe row changes (the insert, update, and delete statements). </p>\u000a<p> The distributed systems literature commonly distinguishes two broad\u000aapproaches to processing and replication. The &quot;state machine\u000amodel&quot; usually refers to an active-active model where we keep a\u000alog of the incoming requests and each replica processes each request.\u000aA slight modification of this, called the &quot;primary-backup\u000amodel&quot;, is to elect one replica as the leader and allow this\u000aleader to process requests in the order they arrive and log out the\u000achanges to its state from processing the requests. The other replicas\u000aapply in order the state changes the leader makes so that they will be\u000ain sync and ready to take over as leader should the leader fail. </p>\u000a<div>\u000a<img src="https://content.linkedin.com/content/dam/engineering/en-us/blog/migrated/active_and_passive_arch.png" style="width: 70.0%;" pagespeed_url_hash="541009001" onload="pagespeed.CriticalImages.checkImageForCriticality(this);">\u000a</div>\u000a<p> To understand the difference between these two approaches, let's\u000alook at a toy problem. Consider a replicated &quot;arithmetic\u000aservice&quot; which maintains a single number as its state\u000a(initialized to zero) and applies additions and multiplications to\u000athis value. The active-active approach might log out the\u000atransformations to apply, say &quot;+1&quot;, &quot;*2&quot;, etc.\u000aEach replica would apply these transformations and hence go through\u000athe same set of values. The &quot;active-passive&quot; approach would\u000ahave a single master execute the transformations and log out the\u000a<i>result</i>, say &quot;1&quot;, &quot;3&quot;, &quot;6&quot;, etc.\u000aThis example also makes it clear why ordering is key for ensuring\u000aconsistency between replicas: reordering an addition and\u000amultiplication will yield a different result. </p>\u000a<p>\u000a<img src="https://content.linkedin.com/content/dam/engineering/en-us/blog/migrated/paxos_postcard.jpg" style="width: 50.0%;" pagespeed_url_hash="439088780" onload="pagespeed.CriticalImages.checkImageForCriticality(this);"> The distributed log can be seen as the data\u000astructure which models the problem of consensus. A log, after all,\u000arepresents a series of decisions on the &quot;next&quot; value to\u000aappend. You have to squint a little to see a log in the Paxos family\u000aof algorithms, though log-building is their most common practical\u000aapplication. With Paxos, this is usually done using an extension of\u000athe protocol called &quot;multi-paxos&quot;, which models the log as a\u000aseries of consensus problems, one for each slot in the log. The log is\u000amuch more prominent in other protocols such as <a href="http://www.stanford.edu/class/cs347/reading/zab.pdf" target="_blank">ZAB</a><a>, </a><a href="https://ramcloud.stanford.edu/wiki/download/attachments/11370504/raft.pdf">RAFT</a>,\u000aand <a href="http://pmg.csail.mit.edu/papers/vr-revisited.pdf" target="_blank">Viewstamped Replication</a>, which directly model\u000athe problem of maintaining a distributed, consistent log. </p>\u000a<p> My suspicion is that our view of this is a little bit biased by the\u000apath of history, perhaps due to the few decades in which the theory of\u000adistributed computing outpaced its practical application. In reality,\u000athe consensus problem is a bit too simple. Computer systems rarely\u000aneed to decide a single value, they almost always handle a sequence of\u000arequests. So a log, rather than a simple single-value register, is the\u000amore natural abstraction. </p>\u000a<p> Furthermore, the focus on the algorithms obscures the underlying log\u000aabstraction systems need. I suspect we will end up focusing more on\u000athe log as a commoditized building block irrespective of its\u000aimplementation in the same way we often talk about a hash table\u000awithout bothering to get in the details of whether we mean the murmur\u000ahash with linear probing or some other variant. The log will become\u000asomething of a commoditized interface, with many algorithms and\u000aimplementations competing to provide the best guarantees and optimal\u000aperformance. </p>\u000a<h3>Changelog 101: Tables and Events are Dual</h3>\u000a<p> Let's come back to databases for a bit. There is a facinating\u000aduality between a log of changes and a table. The log is similar to\u000athe list of all credits and debits and bank processes; a table is all\u000athe current account balances. If you have a log of changes, you can\u000aapply these changes in order to create the table capturing the current\u000astate. This table will record the latest state for each key (as of a\u000aparticular log time). There is a sense in which the log is the more\u000afundamental data structure: in addition to creating the original table\u000ayou can also transform it to create all kinds of derived tables. (And\u000ayes, table can mean keyed data store for the non-relational folks.)\u000a<img src="https://content.linkedin.com/content/dam/engineering/en-us/blog/migrated/yin-yang.jpg" style="width: 30.0%;" pagespeed_url_hash="2800396172" onload="pagespeed.CriticalImages.checkImageForCriticality(this);">\u000a</p>\u000a<p> This process works in reverse too: if you have a table taking\u000aupdates, you can record these changes and publish a\u000a&quot;changelog&quot; of all the updates to the state of the table.\u000aThis changelog is exactly what you need to support near-real-time\u000areplicas. So in this sense you can see tables and events as dual:\u000atables support data at rest and logs capture change. The magic of the\u000alog is that if it is a <i>complete</i> log of changes, it holds not\u000aonly the contents of the final version of the table, but also allows\u000arecreating all other versions that might have existed. It is,\u000aeffectively, a sort of backup of <i>every</i> previous state of the\u000atable. </p>\u000a<p> This might remind you of source code version control. There is a\u000aclose relationship between source control and databases. Version\u000acontrol solves a very similar problem to what distributed data systems\u000ahave to solve\u2014managing distributed, concurrent changes in state. A\u000aversion control system usually models the sequence of patches, which\u000ais in effect a log. You interact directly with a checked out\u000a&quot;snapshot&quot; of the current code which is analogous to the\u000atable. You will note that in version control systems, as in other\u000adistributed stateful systems, replication happens via the log: when\u000ayou update, you pull down just the patches and apply them to your\u000acurrent snapshot. </p>\u000a<p> Some people have seen some of these ideas recently from <a href="http://www.datomic.com/" target="_blank">Datomic</a>, a\u000acompany selling a log-centric database. This <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cym4TZwTCNU">presentation</a>\u000agives a great overview of how they have applied the idea in their\u000asystem. These ideas are not unique to this system, of course, as they\u000ahave been a part of the distributed systems and database literature\u000afor well over a decade. </p>\u000a<p> This may all seem a little theoretical. Do not despair! We'll get to\u000apractical stuff pretty quickly. </p>\u000a<h3>What's next</h3>\u000a<p> In the remainder of this article I will try to give a flavor of what\u000aa log is good for that goes beyond the internals of distributed\u000acomputing or abstract distributed computing models. This includes: </p>\u000a<ol>\u000a<li>\u000a<i>Data Integration</i>\u2014Making all of an organization's data easily\u000aavailable in all its storage and processing systems.\u000a<li>\u000a<i>Real-time data processing</i>\u2014Computing derived data streams.\u000a<li>\u000a<i>Distributed system design</i>\u2014How practical systems can by\u000asimplified with a log-centric design.\u000a</ol>\u000a<p> These uses all resolve around the idea of a log as a stand-alone\u000aservice. </p>\u000a<p> In each case, the usefulness of the log comes from simple function\u000athat the log provides: producing a persistent, re-playable record of\u000ahistory. Surprisingly, at the core of these problems is the ability to\u000ahave many machines playback history at their own rate in a\u000adeterministic manner. </p>\u000a<h2>Part Two: Data Integration</h2>\u000a<p> Let me first say what I mean by &quot;data integration&quot; and why\u000aI think it's important, then we'll see how it relates back to logs. </p>\u000a<div> Data integration is making all the data an organization has\u000aavailable in all its services and systems. </div>\u000a<p> This phrase &quot;data integration&quot; isn't all that common, but\u000aI don't know a better one. The more recognizable term <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extract,_transform,_load" target="_blank">ETL</a> usually covers only a limited part of data\u000aintegration\u2014populating a relational data warehouse. But much of what I\u000aam describing can be thought of as ETL generalized to cover real-time\u000asystems and processing flows. <img src="https://content.linkedin.com/content/dam/engineering/en-us/blog/migrated/cabling.jpg" style="width: 45.0%;" pagespeed_url_hash="1343946100" onload="pagespeed.CriticalImages.checkImageForCriticality(this);">\u000a</p>\u000a<p> You don't hear much about data integration in all the breathless\u000ainterest and hype around the idea of <i>big data</i>, but nonetheless,\u000aI believe this mundane problem of &quot;making the data\u000aavailable&quot; is one of the more valuable things an organization can\u000afocus on. </p>\u000a<p> Effective use of data follows a kind of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maslow's_hierarchy_of_needs" target="_blank">Maslow's hierarchy of needs</a>. The base of the\u000apyramid involves capturing all the relevant data, being able to put it\u000atogether in an applicable processing environment (be that a fancy\u000areal-time query system or just text files and python scripts). This\u000adata needs to be modeled in a uniform way to make it easy to read and\u000aprocess. Once these basic needs of capturing data in a uniform way are\u000ataken care of it is reasonable to work on infrastructure to process\u000athis data in various ways\u2014MapReduce, real-time query systems, etc. </p>\u000a<p> It's worth noting the obvious: without a reliable and complete data\u000aflow, a Hadoop cluster is little more than a very expensive and\u000adifficult to assemble space heater. Once data and processing are\u000aavailable, one can move concern on to more refined problems of good\u000adata models and consistent well understood semantics. Finally,\u000aconcentration can shift to more sophisticated processing\u2014better\u000avisualization, reporting, and algorithmic processing and prediction. </p>\u000a<p> In my experience, most organizations have huge holes in the base of\u000athis pyramid\u2014they lack reliable complete data flow\u2014but want to jump\u000adirectly to advanced data modeling techniques. This is completely\u000abackwards. </p>\u000a<p> So the question is, how can we build reliable data flow throughout\u000aall the data systems in an organization? </p>\u000a<h3>Data Integration: Two complications</h3>\u000a<p> Two trends make data integration harder. </p>\u000a<p>\u000a<b>The event data firehose</b>\u000a</p>\u000a<p> The first trend is the rise of event data. Event data records things\u000athat happen rather than things that are. In web systems, this means\u000auser activity logging, but also the machine-level events and\u000astatistics required to reliably operate and monitor a data center's\u000aworth of machines. People tend to call this &quot;log data&quot; since\u000ait is often written to application logs, but that confuses form with\u000afunction. This data is at the heart of the modern web: Google's\u000afortune, after all, is generated by a relevance pipeline built on\u000aclicks and impressions\u2014that is, events. </p>\u000a<p> And this stuff isn't limited to web companies, it's just that web\u000acompanies are already fully digital, so they are easier to instrument.\u000aFinancial data has long been event-centric. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RFID" target="_blank">RFID</a>\u000aadds this kind of tracking to physical objects. I think this trend\u000awill continue with the <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424053111903480904576512250915629460.html" target="_blank">digitization</a> of traditional businesses and\u000aactivities. </p>\u000a<p> This type of event data records what happened, and tends to be\u000aseveral orders of magnitude larger than traditional database uses.\u000aThis presents significant challenges for processing. </p>\u000a<p>\u000a<b>The explosion of specialized data systems</b>\u000a</p>\u000a<p> The second trend comes from the <a href="http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.68.9136" target="_blank">explosion</a> of specialized data systems that have\u000abecome popular and often freely available in the last five years.\u000aSpecialized systems exist for <a href="https://github.com/metamx/druid/wiki">OLAP</a>, <a href="http://www.elasticsearch.org/" target="_blank">search</a>, <a href="http://www.rethinkdb.com/" target="_blank">simple</a><a href="http://www.slideshare.net/amywtang/espresso-20952131" target="_blank">online</a><a href="http://cassandra.apache.org/" target="_blank">storage</a>, <a href="http://hadoop.apache.org/" target="_blank">batch processing</a>, <a href="http://graphlab.org/" target="_blank">graph analysis</a>, and <a href="http://redis.io/" target="_blank">so</a><a href="http://spark.incubator.apache.org/" target="_blank">on</a>. </p>\u000a<p> The combination of more data of more varieties and a desire to get\u000athis data into more systems leads to a huge data integration problem. </p>\u000a<h3>Log-structured data flow</h3>\u000aThe log is the natural data structure for handling data flow between\u000asystems. The recipe is very simple: <div>Take all the organization's\u000adata and put it into a central log for real-time subscription.</div>\u000a<p> Each logical data source can be modeled as its own log. A data\u000asource could be an application that logs out events (say clicks or\u000apage views), or a database table that accepts modifications. Each\u000asubscribing system reads from this log as quickly as it can, applies\u000aeach new record to its own store, and advances its position in the\u000alog. Subscribers could be any kind of data system\u2014a cache, Hadoop,\u000aanother database in another site, a search system, etc. <img src="https://content.linkedin.com/content/dam/engineering/en-us/blog/migrated/log_subscription.png" style="width: 50.0%;" pagespeed_url_hash="3922020656" onload="pagespeed.CriticalImages.checkImageForCriticality(this);">\u000a</p>\u000a<p> For example, the log concept gives a logical clock for each change\u000aagainst which all subscribers can be measured. This makes reasoning\u000aabout the state of the different subscriber systems with respect to\u000aone another far simpler, as each has a &quot;point in time&quot; they\u000ahave read up to. </p>\u000a<p> To make this more concrete, consider a simple case where there is a\u000adatabase and a collection of caching servers. The log provides a way\u000ato synchronize the updates to all these systems and reason about the\u000apoint of time of each of these systems. Let's say we write a record\u000awith log entry X and then need to do a read from the cache. If we want\u000ato guarantee we don't see stale data, we just need to ensure we don't\u000aread from any cache which has not replicated up to X. </p>\u000a<p> The log also acts as a buffer that makes data production\u000aasynchronous from data consumption. This is important for a lot of\u000areasons, but particularly when there are multiple subscribers that may\u000aconsume at different rates. This means a subscribing system can crash\u000aor go down for maintenance and catch up when it comes back: the\u000asubscriber consumes at a pace it controls. A batch system such as\u000aHadoop or a data warehouse may consume only hourly or daily, whereas a\u000areal-time query system may need to be up-to-the-second. Neither the\u000aoriginating data source nor the log has knowledge of the various data\u000adestination systems, so consumer systems can be added and removed with\u000ano change in the pipeline. </p>\u000a<div>\u000a<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anna_Karenina_principle" target="_blank"><img src="https://content.linkedin.com/content/dam/engineering/en-us/blog/migrated/tolstoy.jpg" style="width: 95.0%;" pagespeed_url_hash="4086466854" onload="pagespeed.CriticalImages.checkImageForCriticality(this);">\u000a</a><div>\u000a<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anna_Karenina_principle" target="_blank">&quot;Each working data pipeline is designed like\u000aa log; each broken data pipeline is broken in its own\u000away.&quot;\u2014Count Leo Tolstoy (translation by the author)</a></div>\u000a</div>\u000a<p> Of particular importance: the destination system only knows about\u000athe log and not any details of the system of origin. The consumer\u000asystem need not concern itself with whether the data came from an\u000aRDBMS, a new-fangled key-value store, or was generated without a\u000areal-time query system of any kind. This seems like a minor point, but\u000ais in fact critical. </p>\u000a<p> I use the term &quot;log&quot; here instead of &quot;messaging\u000asystem&quot; or &quot;pub sub&quot; because it is a lot more specific\u000aabout semantics and a much closer description of what you need in a\u000apractical implementation to support data replication. I have found\u000athat &quot;publish subscribe&quot; doesn't imply much more than\u000aindirect addressing of messages\u2014if you compare any two messaging\u000asystems promising publish-subscribe, you find that they guarantee very\u000adifferent things, and most models are not useful in this domain. You\u000acan think of the log as acting as a kind of messaging system with\u000adurability guarantees and strong ordering semantics. In distributed\u000asystems, this model of communication sometimes goes by the (somewhat\u000aterrible) name of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_broadcast" target="_blank">atomic broadcast</a>. </p>\u000a<p> It's worth emphasizing that the log is still just the\u000ainfrastructure. That isn't the end of the story of mastering data\u000aflow: the rest of the story is around metadata, schemas,\u000acompatibility, and all the details of handling data structure and\u000aevolution. But until there is a reliable, general way of handling the\u000amechanics of data flow, the semantic details are secondary. </p>\u000a<h3>At LinkedIn</h3>\u000aI got to watch this data integration problem emerge in fast-forward as\u000aLinkedIn moved from a centralized relational database to a collection of\u000adistributed systems. <p> These days our major data systems include: </p>\u000a<ul>\u000a<li>\u000a<a href="http://data.linkedin.com/projects/search" target="_blank">Search</a>\u000a<li>\u000a<a href="http://engineering.linkedin.com/real-time-distributed-graph/using-set-cover-algorithm-optimize-query-latency-large-scale-distributed">Social Graph</a>\u000a<li>\u000a<a href="http://project-voldemort.com/" target="_blank">Voldemort</a> (key-value store)\u000a<li>\u000a<a href="http://data.linkedin.com/projects/espresso" target="_blank">Espresso</a> (document store)\u000a<li>\u000a<a href="http://www.quora.com/LinkedIn-Recommendations/How-does-LinkedIns-recommendation-system-work" target="_blank">Recommendation engine</a>\u000a<li> OLAP query engine\u000a<li>\u000a<a href="http://hadoop.apache.org/" target="_blank">Hadoop</a>\u000a<li>\u000a<a href="http://www.teradata.com/" target="_blank">Terradata</a>\u000a<li>\u000a<a href="http://engineering.linkedin.com/52/autometrics-self-service-metrics-collection">Ingraphs</a>\u000a(monitoring graphs and metrics services)\u000a</ul>\u000a<p> Each of these is a specialized distributed system that provides\u000aadvanced functionality in its area of specialty. </p>\u000a<p>\u000a<img src="https://content.linkedin.com/content/dam/engineering/en-us/blog/migrated/linkedin.png" style="width: 250.0px;" pagespeed_url_hash="73061410" onload="pagespeed.CriticalImages.checkImageForCriticality(this);">\u000a</p>\u000a<p> This idea of using logs for data flow has been floating around\u000aLinkedIn since even before I got here. One of the earliest pieces of\u000ainfrastructure we developed was a service called <a href="https://github.com/linkedin/databus">databus</a> that provided a\u000alog caching abstraction on top of our early Oracle tables to scale\u000asubscription to database changes so we could feed our social graph and\u000asearch indexes. </p>\u000a<p> I'll give a little bit of the history to provide context. My own\u000ainvolvement in this started around 2008 after we had shipped our\u000akey-value store. My next project was to try to get a working Hadoop\u000asetup going, and move some of our recommendation processes there.\u000aHaving little experience in this area, we naturally budgeted a few\u000aweeks for getting data in and out, and the rest of our time for\u000aimplementing fancy prediction algorithms. So began a long slog. </p>\u000a<p> We originally planned to just scrape the data out of our existing\u000aOracle data warehouse. The first discovery was that getting data out\u000aof Oracle quickly is something of a dark art. Worse, the data\u000awarehouse processing was not appropriate for the production batch\u000aprocessing we planned for Hadoop\u2014much of the processing was\u000anon-reversable and specific to the reporting being done. We ended up\u000aavoiding the data warehouse and going directly to source databases and\u000alog files. Finally, we implemented another pipeline to <a href="http://data.linkedin.com/blog/2009/06/building-a-terabyte-scale-data-cycle-at-linkedin-with-hadoop-and-project-voldemort" target="_blank">load data into our key-value store</a> for serving\u000aresults. </p>\u000a<p> This mundane data copying ended up being one of the dominate items\u000afor the original development. Worse, any time there was a problem in\u000aany of the pipelines, the Hadoop system was largely useless\u2014running\u000afancy algorithms on bad data just produces more bad data. </p>\u000a<p> Although we had built things in a fairly generic way, each new data\u000asource required custom configuration to set up. It also proved to be\u000athe source of a huge number of errors and failures. The site features\u000awe had implemented on Hadoop became popular and we found ourselves\u000awith a long list of interested engineers. Each user had a list of\u000asystems they wanted integration with and a long list of new data feeds\u000athey wanted. </p>\u000a<div>\u000a<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sisyphus" target="_blank"><img src="https://content.linkedin.com/content/dam/engineering/en-us/blog/migrated/sisyphus.jpg" pagespeed_url_hash="4095350754" onload="pagespeed.CriticalImages.checkImageForCriticality(this);">\u000a</a><div> ETL in Ancient Greece. Not much has changed. </div>\u000a</div>\u000a<p> A few things slowly became clear to me. </p>\u000a<p> First, the pipelines we had built, though a bit of a mess, were\u000aactually extremely valuable. Just the process of making data available\u000ain a new processing system (Hadoop) unlocked a lot of possibilities.\u000aNew computation was possible on the data that would have been hard to\u000ado before. Many new products and analysis just came from putting\u000atogether multiple pieces of data that had previously been locked up in\u000aspecialized systems. </p>\u000a<p> Second, it was clear that reliable data loads would require deep\u000asupport from the data pipeline. If we captured all the structure we\u000aneeded, we could make Hadoop data loads fully automatic, so that no\u000amanual effort was expanded adding new data sources or handling schema\u000achanges\u2014data would just magically appear in HDFS and Hive tables would\u000aautomatically be generated for new data sources with the appropriate\u000acolumns. </p>\u000a<p> Third, we still had very low data coverage. That is, if you looked\u000aat the overall percentage of the data LinkedIn had that was available\u000ain Hadoop, it was still very incomplete. And getting to completion was\u000anot going to be easy given the amount of effort required to\u000aoperationalize each new data source. </p>\u000a<p> The way we had been proceeding, building out custom data loads for\u000aeach data source and destination, was clearly infeasible. We had\u000adozens of data systems and data repositories. Connecting all of these\u000awould have lead to building custom piping between each pair of systems\u000asomething like this: </p>\u000a<p>\u000a<img src="https://content.linkedin.com/content/dam/engineering/en-us/blog/migrated/datapipeline_complex.png" style="width: 100.0%;" pagespeed_url_hash="1218149037" onload="pagespeed.CriticalImages.checkImageForCriticality(this);">\u000a</p>\u000a<p> Note that data often flows in both directions, as many systems\u000a(databases, Hadoop) are both sources and destinations for data\u000atransfer. This meant we would end up building two pipelines per\u000asystem: one to get data in and one to get data out. </p>\u000a<p> This clearly would take an army of people to build and would never\u000abe operable. As we approached fully connectivity we would end up with\u000asomething like O(N2) pipelines. </p>\u000a<p> Instead, we needed something generic like this: </p>\u000a<p>\u000a<img src="https://content.linkedin.com/content/dam/engineering/en-us/blog/migrated/datapipeline_simple.png" style="width: 100.0%;" pagespeed_url_hash="2285382307" onload="pagespeed.CriticalImages.checkImageForCriticality(this);">\u000a</p>\u000a<p> As much as possible, we needed to isolate each consumer from the\u000asource of the data. They should ideally integrate with just a single\u000adata repository that would give them access to everything. </p>\u000a<p> The idea is that adding a new data system\u2014be it a data source or a\u000adata destination\u2014should create integration work only to connect it to\u000aa single pipeline instead of each consumer of data. </p>\u000a<p> This experience lead me to focus on building <a href="http://kafka.apache.org/" target="_blank">Kafka</a> to combine\u000awhat we had seen in messaging systems with the log concept popular in\u000adatabases and distributed system internals. We wanted something to act\u000aas a central pipeline first for all activity data, and eventually for\u000amany other uses, including data deployment out of Hadoop, monitoring\u000adata, etc. </p>\u000a<p> For a long time, Kafka was a little unique (some would say odd) as\u000aan infrastructure product\u2014neither a database nor a log file collection\u000asystem nor a traditional messaging system. But recently Amazon has\u000aoffered a service that is very very similar to Kafka called <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/kinesis" target="_blank">Kinesis</a>.\u000aThe similarity goes right down to the way partitioning is handled,\u000adata is retained, and the fairly odd split in the Kafka API between\u000ahigh- and low-level consumers. I was pretty happy about this. A sign\u000ayou've created a good infrastructure abstraction is that AWS offers it\u000aas a service! Their vision for this seems to be exactly similar to\u000awhat I am describing: it is the piping that connects all their\u000adistributed systems\u2014DynamoDB, RedShift, S3, etc.\u2014as well as the basis\u000afor distributed stream processing using EC2. </p>\u000a<h3>Relationship to ETL and the Data Warehouse</h3>\u000a<p> Let's talk data warehousing for a bit. The data warehouse is meant\u000ato be a repository of the clean, integrated data structured to support\u000aanalysis. This is a great idea. For those not in the know, the data\u000awarehousing methodology involves periodically extracting data from\u000asource databases, munging it into some kind of understandable form,\u000aand loading it into a central data warehouse. Having this central\u000alocation that contains a clean copy of all your data is a hugely\u000avaluable asset for data-intensive analysis and processing. At a high\u000alevel, this methodology doesn't change too much whether you use a\u000atraditional data warehouse like Oracle or Teradata or Hadoop, though\u000ayou might <a href="http://searchdatamanagement.techtarget.com/definition/Extract-Load-Transform-ELT" target="_blank">switch up</a> the order of loading and munging. </p>\u000a<p> A data warehouse containing clean, integrated data is a phenomenal\u000aasset, but the mechanics of getting this are a bit out of date. </p>\u000a<img src="https://content.linkedin.com/content/dam/engineering/en-us/blog/migrated/oracle.jpg" style="width: 50.0%;" pagespeed_url_hash="567302138" onload="pagespeed.CriticalImages.checkImageForCriticality(this);">\u000a<p> The key problem for a data-centric organization is coupling the\u000aclean integrated data to the data warehouse. A data warehouse is a\u000apiece of batch query infrastructure which is well suited to many kinds\u000aof reporting and ad hoc analysis, particularly when the queries\u000ainvolve simple counting, aggregation, and filtering. But having a\u000abatch system be the only repository of clean complete data means the\u000adata is unavailable for systems requiring a real-time feed\u2014real-time\u000aprocessing, search indexing, monitoring systems, etc. </p>\u000a<p> In my view, ETL is really two things. First, it is an extraction and\u000adata cleanup process\u2014essentially liberating data locked up in a\u000avariety of systems in the organization and removing an system-specific\u000anon-sense. Secondly, that data is restructured for data warehousing\u000aqueries (i.e. made to fit the type system of a relational DB, forced\u000ainto a star or snowflake schema, perhaps broken up into a high\u000aperformance <a href="http://parquet.io/" target="_blank">column</a><a href="http://docs.hortonworks.com/HDPDocuments/HDP2/HDP-2.0.0.2/ds_Hive/orcfile.html" target="_blank">format</a>, etc). Conflating these two things is a\u000aproblem. The clean, integrated repository of data should be available\u000ain real-time as well for low-latency processing as well as indexing in\u000aother real-time storage systems. </p>\u000a<p> I think this has the added benefit of making data warehousing ETL\u000amuch more <i>organizationally</i> scalable. The classic problem of the\u000adata warehouse team is that they are responsible for collecting and\u000acleaning all the data generated by every other team in the\u000aorganization. The incentives are not aligned: data producers are often\u000anot very aware of the use of the data in the data warehouse and end up\u000acreating data that is hard to extract or requires heavy, hard to scale\u000atransformation to get into usable form. Of course, the central team\u000anever quite manages to scale to match the pace of the rest of the\u000aorganization, so data coverage is always spotty, data flow is fragile,\u000aand changes are slow. </p>\u000a<p> A better approach is to have a central pipeline, the log, with a\u000awell defined API for adding data. The responsibility of integrating\u000awith this pipeline and providing a clean, well-structured data feed\u000alies with the producer of this data feed. This means that as part of\u000atheir system design and implementation they must consider the problem\u000aof getting data out and into a well structured form for delivery to\u000athe central pipeline. The addition of new storage systems is of no\u000aconsequence to the data warehouse team as they have a central point of\u000aintegration. The data warehouse team handles only the simpler problem\u000aof loading structured feeds of data from the central log and carrying\u000aout transformation specific to their system. </p>\u000a<p>\u000a<img src="https://content.linkedin.com/content/dam/engineering/en-us/blog/migrated/pipeline_ownership.png" style="width: 65.0%;" pagespeed_url_hash="805160834" onload="pagespeed.CriticalImages.checkImageForCriticality(this);">\u000a</p>\u000a<p> This point about organizational scalability becomes particularly\u000aimportant when one considers adopting additional data systems beyond a\u000atraditional data warehouse. Say, for example, that one wishes to\u000aprovide search capabilities over the complete data set of the\u000aorganization. Or, say that one wants to provide sub-second monitoring\u000aof data streams with real-time trend graphs and alerting. In either of\u000athese cases, the infrastructure of the traditional data warehouse or\u000aeven a Hadoop cluster is going to be inappropriate. Worse, the ETL\u000aprocessing pipeline built to support database loads is likely of no\u000ause for feeding these other systems, making bootstrapping these pieces\u000aof infrastructure as large an undertaking as adopting a data\u000awarehouse. This likely isn't feasible and probably helps explain why\u000amost organizations do not have these capabilities easily available for\u000aall their data. By contrast, if the organization had built out feeds\u000aof uniform, well-structured data, getting any new system full access\u000ato all data requires only a single bit of integration plumbing to\u000aattach to the pipeline. </p>\u000a<p> This architecture also raises a set of different options for where a\u000aparticular cleanup or transformation can reside: </p>\u000a<ol>\u000a<li>It can be done by the data producer prior to adding the data to\u000athe company wide log.\u000a<li>It can be done as a real-time transformation on the log (which in\u000aturn produces a new, transformed log)\u000a<li>It can be done as part of the load process into some destination\u000adata system\u000a</ol>\u000a<p> The best model is to have <i>cleanup</i> done prior to publishing\u000athe data to the log by the publisher of the data. This means ensuring\u000athe data is in a canonical form and doesn't retain any hold-overs from\u000athe particular code that produced it or the storage system in which it\u000amay have been maintained. These details are best handled by the team\u000athat creates the data since they know the most about their own data.\u000aAny logic applied in this stage should be lossless and reversible. </p>\u000a<p> Any kind of value-added transformation that can be done in real-time\u000ashould be done as post-processing on the raw log feed produced. This\u000awould include things like sessionization of event data, or the\u000aaddition of other derived fields that are of general interest. The\u000aoriginal log is still available, but this real-time processing\u000aproduces a derived log containing augmented data. </p>\u000a<p> Finally, only aggregation that is specific to the destination system\u000ashould be performed as part of the loading process. This might include\u000atransforming data into a particular star or snowflake schema for\u000aanalysis and reporting in a data warehouse. Because this stage, which\u000amost naturally maps to the traditional ETL process, is now done on a\u000afar cleaner and more uniform set of streams, it should be much\u000asimplified. </p>\u000a<h3>Log Files and Events</h3>\u000a<p> Let's talk a little bit about a side benefit of this architecture:\u000ait enables decoupled, event-driven systems. </p>\u000a<p> The typical approach to activity data in the web industry is to log\u000ait out to text files where it can be scrapped into a data warehouse or\u000ainto Hadoop for aggregation and querying. The problem with this is the\u000asame as the problem with all batch ETL: it couples the data flow to\u000athe data warehouse's capabilities and processing schedule. </p>\u000a<p> At LinkedIn, we have built our event data handling in a log-centric\u000afashion. We are using Kafka as the central, multi-subscriber event\u000alog. We have defined several hundred event types, each capturing the\u000aunique attributes about a particular type of action. This covers\u000aeverything from page views, ad impressions, and searches, to service\u000ainvocations and application exceptions. </p>\u000a<p> To understand the advantages of this, imagine a simple event\u2014showing\u000aa job posting on the job page. The job page should contain only the\u000alogic required to display the job. However, in a fairly dynamic site,\u000athis could easily become larded up with additional logic unrelated to\u000ashowing the job. For example let's say we need to integrate the\u000afollowing systems: </p>\u000a<ol>\u000a<li> We need to send this data to Hadoop and data warehouse for\u000aoffline processing purposes\u000a<li> We need to count the view to ensure that the viewer is not\u000aattempting some kind of content scraping\u000a<li> We need to aggregate this view for display in the Job poster's\u000aanalytics page\u000a<li> We need to record the view to ensure we properly impression cap\u000aany job recommendations for that user (we don't want to show the\u000asame thing over and over)\u000a<li> Our recommendation system may need to record the view to\u000acorrectly track the popularity of that job\u000a<li> Etc\u000a</ol>\u000a<p> Pretty soon, the simple act of displaying a job has become quite\u000acomplex. And as we add other places where jobs are displayed\u2014mobile\u000aapplications, and so on\u2014this logic must be carried over and the\u000acomplexity increases. Worse, the systems that we need to interface\u000awith are now somewhat intertwined\u2014the person working on displaying\u000ajobs needs to know about many other systems and features and make sure\u000athey are integrated properly. This is just a toy version of the\u000aproblem, any real application would be more, not less, complex. </p>\u000a<p> The &quot;event-driven&quot; style provides an approach to\u000asimplifying this. The job display page now just shows a job and\u000arecords the fact that a job was shown along with the relevant\u000aattributes of the job, the viewer, and any other useful facts about\u000athe display of the job. Each of the other interested systems\u2014the\u000arecommendation system, the security system, the job poster analytics\u000asystem, and the data warehouse\u2014all just subscribe to the feed and do\u000atheir processing. The display code need not be aware of these other\u000asystems, and needn't be changed if a new data consumer is added. </p>\u000a<h3>Building a Scalable Log</h3>\u000a<p> Of course, separating publishers from subscribers is nothing new.\u000aBut if you want to keep a commit log that acts as a multi-subscriber\u000areal-time journal of everything happening on a consumer-scale website,\u000ascalability will be a primary challenge. Using a log as a universal\u000aintegration mechanism is never going to be more than an elegant\u000afantasy if we can't build a log that is fast, cheap, and scalable\u000aenough to make this practical at scale. </p>\u000a<p> Systems people typically think of a distributed log as a slow,\u000aheavy-weight abstraction (and usually associate it only with the kind\u000aof &quot;metadata&quot; uses for which Zookeeper might be\u000aappropriate). But with a thoughtful implementation focused on\u000ajournaling large data streams, this need not be true. At LinkedIn we\u000aare currently running over 60 billion unique message writes through\u000aKafka per day (several hundred billion if you count the writes from <a href="http://kafka.apache.org/documentation.html#datacenters" target="_blank">mirroring between datacenters</a>). </p>\u000a<p> We used a few tricks in Kafka to support this kind of scale: </p>\u000a<ol>\u000a<li>Partitioning the log\u000a<li>Optimizing throughput by batching reads and writes\u000a<li>Avoiding needless data copies\u000a</ol>\u000a<p> In order to allow horizontal scaling we chop up our log into\u000apartitions: </p>\u000a<p>\u000a<img src="https://content.linkedin.com/content/dam/engineering/en-us/blog/migrated/partitioned_log.png" style="width: 350.0px;" pagespeed_url_hash="1497371952" onload="pagespeed.CriticalImages.checkImageForCriticality(this);"> Each partition is a totally ordered log, but\u000athere is no global ordering between partitions (other than perhaps\u000asome wall-clock time you might include in your messages). The\u000aassignment of the messages to a particular partition is controllable\u000aby the writer, with most users choosing to partition by some kind of\u000akey (e.g. user id). Partitioning allows log appends to occur without\u000aco-ordination between shards and allows the throughput of the system\u000ato scale linearly with the Kafka cluster size. </p>\u000a<p> Each partition is replicated across a configurable number of\u000areplicas, each of which has an identical copy of the partition's log.\u000aAt any time, a single one of them will act as the leader; if the\u000aleader fails, one of the replicas will take over as leader. </p>\u000a<p> Lack of a global order across partitions is a limitation, but we\u000ahave not found it to be a major one. Indeed, interaction with the log\u000atypically comes from hundreds or thousands of distinct processes so it\u000ais not meaningful to talk about a total order over their behavior.\u000aInstead, the guarantees that we provide are that each partition is\u000aorder preserving, and Kafka guarantees that appends to a particular\u000apartition from a single sender will be delivered in the order they are\u000asent. </p>\u000a<p> A log, like a filesystem, is easy to optimize for linear read and\u000awrite patterns. The log can group small reads and writes together into\u000alarger, high-throughput operations. Kafka pursues this optimization\u000aaggressively. Batching occurs from client to server when sending data,\u000ain writes to disk, in replication between servers, in data transfer to\u000aconsumers, and in acknowledging committed data. </p>\u000a<p> Finally, Kafka uses a simple binary format that is maintained\u000abetween in-memory log, on-disk log, and in network data transfers.\u000aThis allows us to make use of numerous optimizations including <a href="https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/library/j-zerocopy">zero-copy\u000adata transfer</a>. </p>\u000a<p> The cumulative effect of these optimizations is that you can usually\u000awrite and read data at the rate supported by the disk or network, even\u000awhile maintaining data sets that vastly exceed memory. </p>\u000a<p> This write-up isn't meant to be primarily about Kafka so I won't go\u000ainto further details. You can read a more detailed overview of\u000aLinkedIn's approach <a href="http://sites.computer.org/debull/A12june/pipeline.pdf" target="_blank">here</a> and a thorough overview of Kafka's design <a href="http://kafka.apache.org/documentation.html#design" target="_blank">here</a>. </p>\u000a<h2>Part Three: Logs &amp; Real-time Stream Processing</h2>\u000a<p> So far, I have only described what amounts to a fancy method of\u000acopying data from place-to-place. But shlepping bytes between storage\u000asystems is not the end of the story. It turns out that &quot;log&quot;\u000ais another word for &quot;stream&quot; and logs are at the heart of <a href="http://highlyscalable.wordpress.com/2013/08/20/in-stream-big-data-processing/" target="_blank">stream processing</a>. </p>\u000a<p> But, wait, what exactly is stream processing? </p>\u000a<p> If you are a fan of late 90s and early 2000s <a href="http://cs.brown.edu/research/aurora/vldb03_journal.pdf" target="_blank">database</a><a href="http://db.cs.berkeley.edu/papers/cidr03-tcq.pdf" target="_blank">literature</a> or semi-successful <a href="http://www-03.ibm.com/software/products/us/en/infosphere-streams" target="_blank">data</a><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/StreamBase_Systems" target="_blank">infrastructure</a><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truviso" target="_blank">products</a>, you likely associate stream processing\u000awith efforts to build a SQL engine or &quot;boxes and arrows&quot;\u000ainterface for event driven processing. </p>\u000a<p> If you follow the explosion of open source data systems, you likely\u000aassociate stream processing with some of the systems in this space\u2014for\u000aexample, <a href="http://storm-project.net/" target="_blank">Storm</a>, <a href="http://akka.io/" target="_blank">Akka</a>, <a href="http://incubator.apache.org/s4" target="_blank">S4</a>, and Samza. But most people see these as a kind\u000aof asynchronous message processing system not that different from a\u000acluster-aware RPC layer (and in fact some things in this space are\u000aexactly that). </p>\u000a<p> Both these views are a little limited. Stream processing has nothing\u000ato do with SQL. Nor is it limited to real-time processing. There is no\u000ainherent reason you can't process the stream of data from yesterday or\u000aa month ago using a variety of different languages to express the\u000acomputation. <img src="https://content.linkedin.com/content/dam/engineering/en-us/blog/migrated/census.jpg" style="" pagespeed_url_hash="379280321" onload="pagespeed.CriticalImages.checkImageForCriticality(this);">\u000a</p>\u000a<p> I see stream processing as something much broader: infrastructure\u000afor continuous data processing. I think the computational model can be\u000aas general as MapReduce or other distributed processing frameworks,\u000abut with the ability to produce low-latency results. </p>\u000a<p> The real driver for the processing model is the method of data\u000acollection. Data which is collected in batch is naturally processed in\u000abatch. When data is collected continuously, it is naturally processed\u000acontinuously. </p>\u000a<p> The US census provides a good example of batch data collection. The\u000acensus periodically kicks off and does a brute force discovery and\u000aenumeration of US citizens by having people walking around\u000adoor-to-door. This made a lot of sense in 1790 when the census was\u000afirst begun. Data collection at the time was inherently batch\u000aoriented, it involved riding around on horseback and writing down\u000arecords on paper, then transporting this batch of records to a central\u000alocation where humans added up all the counts. These days, when you\u000adescribe the census process one immediately wonders why we don't keep\u000aa journal of births and deaths and produce population counts either\u000acontinuously or with whatever granularity is needed. </p>\u000a<p> This is an extreme example, but many data transfer processes still\u000adepend on taking periodic dumps and bulk transfer and integration. The\u000aonly natural way to process a bulk dump is with a batch process. But\u000aas these processes are replaced with continuous feeds, one naturally\u000astarts to move towards continuous processing to smooth out the\u000aprocessing resources needed and reduce latency. </p>\u000a<p> LinkedIn, for example, has almost no batch data collection at all.\u000aThe majority of our data is either activity data or database changes,\u000aboth of which occur continuously. In fact, when you think about any\u000abusiness, the underlying mechanics are almost always a continuous\u000aprocess\u2014events happen in real-time, as Jack Bauer would tell us. When\u000adata is collected in batches, it is almost always due to some manual\u000astep or lack of digitization or is a historical relic left over from\u000athe automation of some non-digital process. Transmitting and reacting\u000ato data used to be very slow when the mechanics were mail and humans\u000adid the processing. A first pass at automation always retains the form\u000aof the original process, so this often lingers for a long time. </p>\u000a<p> Production &quot;batch&quot; processing jobs that run daily are\u000aoften effectively mimicking a kind of continuous computation with a\u000awindow size of one day. The underlying data is, of course, always\u000achanging. These were actually so common at LinkedIn (and the mechanics\u000aof making them work in Hadoop so tricky) that we implemented a whole\u000a<a href="http://engineering.linkedin.com/datafu/datafus-hourglass-incremental-data-processing-hadoop">framework</a>\u000afor managing incremental Hadoop workflows. </p>\u000a<p> Seen in this light, it is easy to have a different view of stream\u000aprocessing: it is just processing which includes a notion of time in\u000athe underlying data being processed and does not require a static\u000asnapshot of the data so it can produce output at a user-controlled\u000afrequency instead of waiting for the &quot;end&quot; of the data set\u000ato be reached. In this sense, stream processing is a generalization of\u000abatch processing, and, given the prevalence of real-time data, a very\u000aimportant generalization. </p>\u000a<p> So why has the traditional view of stream processing been as a niche\u000aapplication? I think the biggest reason is that a lack of real-time\u000adata collection made continuous processing something of an academic\u000aconcern. </p>\u000a<p> I think the lack of real-time data collection is likely what doomed\u000athe commercial stream-processing systems. Their customers were still\u000adoing file-oriented, daily batch processing for ETL and data\u000aintegration. Companies building stream processing systems focused on\u000aproviding processing engines to attach to real-time data streams, but\u000ait turned out that at the time very few people actually had real-time\u000adata streams. Actually, very early at my career at LinkedIn, a company\u000atried to sell us a very cool stream processing system, but since all\u000aour data was collected in hourly files at that time, the best\u000aapplication we could come up with was to pipe the hourly files into\u000athe stream system at the end of the hour! They noted that this was a\u000afairly common problem. The exception actually proves the rule here:\u000afinance, the one domain where stream processing has met with some\u000asuccess, was exactly the area where real-time data streams were\u000aalready the norm and processing had become the bottleneck. </p>\u000a<p> Even in the presence of a healthy batch processing ecosystem, I\u000athink the actual applicability of stream processing as an\u000ainfrastructure style is quite broad. I think it covers the gap in\u000ainfrastructure between real-time request/response services and offline\u000abatch processing. For modern internet companies, I think around 25% of\u000atheir code falls into this category. </p>\u000a<p> It turns out that the log solves some of the most critical technical\u000aproblems in stream processing, which I'll describe, but the biggest\u000aproblem that it solves is just making data available in real-time\u000amulti-subscriber data feeds. For those interested in more details, we\u000ahave open sourced <a href="http://samza.incubator.apache.org/" target="_blank">Samza</a>, a stream processing system explicitly built\u000aon many of these ideas. We describe a lot of these applications in\u000amore detail in the documentation <a href="http://samza.incubator.apache.org/learn/documentation/0.7.0" target="_blank">here</a>. </p>\u000a<h3>Data flow graphs</h3>\u000a<img src="https://content.linkedin.com/content/dam/engineering/en-us/blog/migrated/dag.png" style="" pagespeed_url_hash="2968421244" onload="pagespeed.CriticalImages.checkImageForCriticality(this);">\u000a<p> The most interesting aspect of stream processing has nothing to do\u000awith the internals of a stream processing system, but instead has to\u000ado with how it extends our idea of what a data feed is from the\u000aearlier data integration discussion. We discussed primarily feeds or\u000alogs of primary data\u2014the events and rows of data produced in the\u000aexecution of various applications. But stream processing allows us to\u000aalso include feeds computed off other feeds. These derived feeds look\u000ano different to consumers then the feeds of primary data from which\u000athey are computed. These derived feeds can encapsulate arbitrary\u000acomplexity. </p>\u000a<p> Let's dive into this a bit. A stream processing job, for our\u000apurposes, will be anything that reads from logs and writes output to\u000alogs or other systems. The logs they use for input and output join\u000athese processes into a graph of processing stages. Indeed, using a\u000acentralized log in this fashion, you can view all the organization's\u000adata capture, transformation, and flow as just a series of logs and\u000aprocesses that write to them. </p>\u000a<p> A stream processor need not have a fancy framework at all: it can be\u000aany process or set of processes that read and write from logs, but\u000aadditional infrastructure and support can be provided for helping\u000amanage processing code. </p>\u000a<p> The purpose of the log in the integration is two-fold. </p>\u000a<p> First, it makes each dataset multi-subscriber and ordered. Recall\u000aour &quot;state replication&quot; principle to remember the importance\u000aof order. To make this more concrete, consider a stream of updates\u000afrom a database\u2014if we re-order two updates to the same record in our\u000aprocessing we may produce the wrong final output. This order is more\u000apermanent than what is provided by something like TCP as it is not\u000alimited to a single point-to-point link and survives beyond process\u000afailures and reconnections. </p>\u000a<p> Second, the log provides buffering to the processes. This is very\u000afundamental. If processing proceeds in an unsynchronized fashion it is\u000alikely to happen that an upstream data producing job will produce data\u000amore quickly than another downstream job can consume it. When this\u000aoccurs processing must block, buffer or drop data. Dropping data is\u000alikely not an option; blocking may cause the entire processing graph\u000ato grind to a halt. The log acts as a very, very large buffer that\u000aallows process to be restarted or fail without slowing down other\u000aparts of the processing graph. This isolation is particularly\u000aimportant when extending this data flow to a larger organization,\u000awhere processing is happening by jobs made by many different teams. We\u000acannot have one faulty job cause back-pressure that stops the entire\u000aprocessing flow. </p>\u000a<p> Both <a href="http://storm-project.net/" target="_blank">Storm</a>\u000aand <a href="http://samza.incubator.apache.org/" target="_blank">Samza</a> are built in this fashion and can use Kafka\u000aor other similar systems as their log. </p>\u000a<h3>Stateful Real-Time Processing</h3>\u000a<p> Some real-time stream processing is just stateless record-at-a-time\u000atransformation, but many of the uses are more sophisticated counts,\u000aaggregations, or joins over windows in the stream. One might, for\u000aexample, want to enrich an event stream (say a stream of clicks) with\u000ainformation about the user doing the click\u2014in effect joining the click\u000astream to the user account database. Invariably, this kind of\u000aprocessing ends up requiring some kind of state to be maintained by\u000athe processor: for example, when computing a count, you have the count\u000aso far to maintain. How can this kind of state be maintained correctly\u000aif the processors themselves can fail? </p>\u000a<p> The simplest alternative would be to keep state in memory. However\u000aif the process crashed it would lose its intermediate state. If state\u000ais only maintained over a window, the process could just fall back to\u000athe point in the log where the window began. However, if one is doing\u000aa count over an hour, this may not be feasible. </p>\u000a<p> An alternative is to simply store all state in a remote storage\u000asystem and join over the network to that store. The problem with this\u000ais that there is no locality of data and lots of network round-trips. </p>\u000a<p> How can we support something like a &quot;table&quot; that is\u000apartitioned up with our processing? </p>\u000a<p> Well recall the discussion of the duality of tables and logs. This\u000agives us exactly the tool to be able to convert streams to tables\u000aco-located with our processing, as well as a mechanism for handling\u000afault tolerance for these tables. </p>\u000a<p> A stream processor can keep it's state in a local &quot;table&quot;\u000aor &quot;index&quot;\u2014a <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/products/berkeleydb" target="_blank">bdb</a>, <a href="https://code.google.com/p/leveldb">leveldb</a>, or even\u000asomething more unusual such as a <a href="http://lucene.apache.org/" target="_blank">Lucene</a> or <a href="https://sdm.lbl.gov/fastbit">fastbit</a> index. The contents of\u000athis this store is fed from its input streams (after first perhaps\u000aapplying arbitrary transformation). It can journal out a changelog for\u000athis local index it keeps to allow it to restore its state in the\u000aevent of a crash and restart. This mechanism allows a generic\u000amechanism for keeping co-partitioned state in arbitrary index types\u000alocal with the incoming stream data. </p>\u000a<p> When the process fails, it restores its index from the changelog.\u000aThe log is the transformation of the local state into a sort of\u000aincremental record at a time backup. </p>\u000a<p> This approach to state management has the elegant property that the\u000astate of the processors is also maintained as a log. We can think of\u000athis log just like we would the log of changes to a database table. In\u000afact, the processors have something very like a co-partitioned table\u000amaintained along with them. Since this state is itself a log, other\u000aprocessors can subscribe to it. This can actually be quite useful in\u000acases when the goal of the processing is to update a final state and\u000athis state is the natural output of the processing. </p>\u000a<p> When combined with the logs coming out of databases for data\u000aintegration purposes, the power of the log/table duality becomes\u000aclear. A change log may be extracted from a database and indexed in\u000adifferent forms by various stream processors to join against event\u000astreams. </p>\u000a<p> We give more detail on this style of managing stateful processing in\u000aSamza and a lot more practical examples <a href="http://samza.incubator.apache.org/learn/documentation/0.7.0/container/state-management.html" target="_blank">here</a>. </p>\u000a<h3>Log Compaction</h3>\u000a<p>\u000a<img src="https://content.linkedin.com/content/dam/engineering/en-us/blog/migrated/log_compaction_0.png" style="width: 60.0%;" pagespeed_url_hash="4264647581" onload="pagespeed.CriticalImages.checkImageForCriticality(this);"> Of course, we can't hope to keep a complete log\u000afor all state changes for all time. Unless one wants to use infinite\u000aspace, somehow the log must be cleaned up. I'll talk a little about\u000athe implementation of this in Kafka to make it more concrete. In\u000aKafka, cleanup has two options depending on whether the data contains\u000akeyed updates or event data. For event data, Kafka supports just\u000aretaining a window of data. Usually, this is configured to a few days,\u000abut the window can be defined in terms of time or space. For keyed\u000adata, though, a nice property of the complete log is that you can\u000areplay it to recreate the state of the source system (potentially\u000arecreating it in another system). </p>\u000a<p> However, retaining the complete log will use more and more space as\u000atime goes by, and the replay will take longer and longer. Hence, in\u000aKafka, we support a different type of retention. Instead of simply\u000athrowing away the old log, we remove obsolete records\u2014i.e. records\u000awhose primary key has a more recent update. By doing this, we still\u000aguarantee that the log contains a complete backup of the source\u000asystem, but now we can no longer recreate <i>all</i> previous states\u000aof the source system, only the more recent ones. We call this feature\u000a<a href="https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/Log+Compaction">log\u000acompaction</a>. </p>\u000a<h2>Part Four: System Building</h2>\u000a<p> The final topic I want to discuss is the role of the log in data\u000asystem design for online data systems. </p>\u000a<p> There is an analogy here between the role a log serves for data flow\u000ainside a distributed database and the role it serves for data\u000aintegration in a larger organization. In both cases, it is responsible\u000afor data flow, consistency, and recovery. What, after all, is an\u000aorganization, if not a very complicated distributed data system? </p>\u000a<h3>Unbundling?</h3>\u000a<p> So maybe if you squint a bit, you can see the whole of your\u000aorganization's systems and data flows as a single distributed\u000adatabase. You can view all the individual query-oriented systems\u000a(Redis, SOLR, Hive tables, and so on) as just particular indexes on\u000ayour data. You can view the stream processing systems like Storm or\u000aSamza as just a very well-developed trigger and view materialization\u000amechanism. Classical database people, I have noticed, like this view\u000avery much because it finally explains to them what on earth people are\u000adoing with all these different data systems\u2014they are just different\u000aindex types! </p>\u000a<p> There is undeniably now an explosion of types of data systems, but\u000ain reality, this complexity has always existed. Even in the heyday of\u000athe relational database, organizations had lots and lots of relational\u000adatabases! So perhaps real integration hasn't existed since the\u000amainframe when all the data really was in one place. There are many\u000amotivations for segregating data into multiple systems: scale,\u000ageography, security, and performance isolation are the most common.\u000aBut these issues can be addressed by a good system: it is possible for\u000aan organization to have a single Hadoop cluster, for example, that\u000acontains all the data and serves a large and diverse constituency. </p>\u000a<p> So there is already one possible simplification in the handling of\u000adata that has become possible in the move to distributed systems:\u000acoalescing lots of little instances of each system into a few big\u000aclusters. Many systems aren't good enough to allow this yet: they\u000adon't have security, or can't guarantee performance isolation, or just\u000adon't scale well enough. But each of these problems is solvable. </p>\u000a<p> My take is that the explosion of different systems is caused by the\u000adifficulty of building distributed data systems. By cutting back to a\u000asingle query type or use case each system is able to bring its scope\u000adown into the set of things that are feasible to build. But running\u000aall these systems yields too much complexity. </p>\u000a<p> I see three possible directions this could follow in the future. </p>\u000a<p> The first possibility is a continuation of the status quo: the\u000aseparation of systems remains more or less as it is for a good deal\u000alonger. This could happen either because the difficulty of\u000adistribution is too hard to overcome or because this specialization\u000aallows new levels of convenience and power for each system. As long as\u000athis remains true, the data integration problem will remain one of the\u000amost centrally important things for the successful use of data. In\u000athis case, an external log that integrates data will be very\u000aimportant. </p>\u000a<p> The second possibility is that there could be a re-consolidation in\u000awhich a single system with enough generality starts to merge back in\u000aall the different functions into a single uber-system. This\u000auber-system could be like the relational database superficially, but\u000ait's use in an organization would be far different as you would need\u000aonly one big one instead of umpteen little ones. In this world, there\u000ais no real data integration problem except what is solved inside this\u000asystem. I think the practical difficulties of building such a system\u000amake this unlikely. </p>\u000a<p> There is another possible outcome, though, which I actually find\u000aappealing as an engineer. One interesting facet of the new generation\u000aof data systems is that they are virtually all open source. Open\u000asource allows another possibility: data infrastructure could be\u000aunbundled into a collection of services and application-facing system\u000aapis. You already see this happening to a certain extent in the Java\u000astack: </p>\u000a<ul>\u000a<li>\u000a<a href="http://zookeeper.apache.org/" target="_blank">Zookeeper</a>\u000ahandles much of the system co-ordination (perhaps with a bit of help\u000afrom higher-level abstractions like <a href="http://helix.incubator.apache.org/" target="_blank">Helix</a> or <a href="http://curator.incubator.apache.org/" target="_blank">Curator</a>).\u000a<li>\u000a<a href="http://mesos.apache.org/" target="_blank">Mesos</a> and <a href="http://hadoop.apache.org/docs/current/hadoop-yarn/hadoop-yarn-site/YARN.html" target="_blank">YARN</a> do process virtualization and resource\u000amanagement\u000a<li>Embedded libraries like <a href="http://lucene.apache.org/" target="_blank">Lucene</a> and <a href="https://code.google.com/p/leveldb">LevelDB</a> do indexing\u000a<li>\u000a<a href="http://netty.io/" target="_blank">Netty</a>, <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/jetty" target="_blank">Jetty</a> and\u000ahigher-level wrappers like <a href="http://twitter.github.io/finagle" target="_blank">Finagle</a> and <a href="http://rest.li/" target="_blank">rest.li</a> handle remote communication\u000a<li>\u000a<a href="http://avro.apache.org/" target="_blank">Avro</a>, <a href="https://code.google.com/p/protobuf">Protocol Buffers</a>, <a href="http://thrift.apache.org/" target="_blank">Thrift</a>, and\u000a<a href="https://github.com/eishay/jvm-serializers/wiki">umpteen\u000azillion</a> other libraries handle serialization\u000a<li>\u000a<a href="http://kafka.apache.org/" target="_blank">Kafka</a> and <a href="http://zookeeper.apache.org/bookkeeper" target="_blank">Bookeeper</a> provide a backing log.\u000a</ul>\u000a<p> If you stack these things in a pile and squint a bit, it starts to\u000alook a bit like a lego version of distributed data system engineering.\u000aYou can piece these ingredients together to create a vast array of\u000apossible systems. This is clearly not a story relevant to end-users\u000awho presumably care primarily more about the API then how it is\u000aimplemented, but it might be a path towards getting the simplicity of\u000athe single system in a more diverse and modular world that continues\u000ato evolve. If the implementation time for a distributed system goes\u000afrom years to weeks because reliable, flexible building blocks emerge,\u000athen the pressure to coalesce into a single monolithic system\u000adisappears. </p>\u000a<h3>The place of the log in system architecture</h3>\u000a<p> A system that assumes an external log is present allows the\u000aindividual systems to relinquish a lot of their own complexity and\u000arely on the shared log. Here are the things I think a log can do: </p>\u000a<ul>\u000a<li>Handle data consistency (whether eventual or immediate) by\u000asequencing concurrent updates to nodes\u000a<li>Provide data replication between nodes\u000a<li>Provide &quot;commit&quot; semantics to the writer (i.e.\u000aacknowledging only when your write guaranteed not to be lost)\u000a<li>Provide the external data subscription feed from the system\u000a<li>Provide the capability to restore failed replicas that lost their\u000adata or bootstrap new replicas\u000a<li>Handle rebalancing of data between nodes.\u000a</ul>\u000a<p> This is actually a substantial portion of what a distributed data\u000asystem does. In fact, the majority of what is left over is related to\u000athe final client-facing query API and indexing strategy. This is\u000aexactly the part that should vary from system to system: for example,\u000aa full-text search query may need to query all partitions whereas a\u000aquery by primary key may only need to query a single node responsible\u000afor that key's data. </p>\u000a<p> Here is how this works. The system is divided into two logical\u000apieces: the log and the serving layer. The log captures the state\u000achanges in sequential order. The serving nodes store whatever index is\u000arequired to serve queries (for example a key-value store might have\u000asomething like a btree or sstable, a search system would have an\u000ainverted index). Writes may either go directly to the log, though they\u000amay be proxied by the serving layer. Writing to the log yields a\u000alogical timestamp (say the index in the log). If the system is\u000apartitioned, and I assume it is, then the log and the serving nodes\u000awill have the same number of partitions, though they may have very\u000adifferent numbers of machines. <img src="https://content.linkedin.com/content/dam/engineering/en-us/blog/migrated/system.png" style="" pagespeed_url_hash="830001839" onload="pagespeed.CriticalImages.checkImageForCriticality(this);">\u000a</p>\u000a<p> The serving nodes subscribe to the log and apply writes as quickly\u000aas possible to its local index in the order the log has stored them. </p>\u000a<p> The client can get read-your-write semantics from any node by\u000aproviding the timestamp of a write as part of its query\u2014a serving node\u000areceiving such a query will compare the desired timestamp to its own\u000aindex point and if necessary delay the request until it has indexed up\u000ato at least that time to avoid serving stale data. </p>\u000a<p> The serving nodes may or may not need to have any notion of\u000a&quot;mastership&quot; or &quot;leader election&quot;. For many simple\u000ause cases, the serving nodes can be completely without leaders, since\u000athe log is the source of truth. </p>\u000a<p> One of the trickier things a distributed system must do is handle\u000arestoring failed nodes or moving partitions from node to node. A\u000atypical approach would have the log retain only a fixed window of data\u000aand combine this with a snapshot of the data stored in the partition.\u000aIt is equally possible for the log to retain a complete copy of data\u000aand <a href="https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/Log+Compaction">garbage\u000acollect the log itself</a>. This moves a significant amount of\u000acomplexity out of the serving layer, which is system-specific, and\u000ainto the log, which can be general purpose. </p>\u000a<p> By having this log system, you get a fully developed subscription\u000aAPI for the contents of the data store which feeds ETL into other\u000asystems. In fact, many systems can share the same the log while\u000aproviding different indexes, like this: </p>\u000a<div>\u000a<img src="https://content.linkedin.com/content/dam/engineering/en-us/blog/migrated/full-stack.png" style="width: 80.0%;" pagespeed_url_hash="1813010678" onload="pagespeed.CriticalImages.checkImageForCriticality(this);">\u000a</div>\u000a<p> Note how such a log-centric system is itself immediately a provider\u000aof data streams for processing and loading in other systems. Likewise,\u000aa stream processor can consume multiple input streams and then serve\u000athem via another system that indexes that output. </p>\u000a<p> I find this view of systems as factored into a log and query api to\u000avery revealing, as it lets you separate the query characteristics from\u000athe availability and consistency aspects of the system. I actually\u000athink this is even a useful way to mentally factor a system that isn't\u000abuilt this way to better understand it. </p>\u000a<p> It's worth noting that although Kafka and Bookeeper are consistent\u000alogs, this is not a requirement. You could just as easily factor a <a href="http://www.allthingsdistributed.com/2007/10/amazons_dynamo.html" target="_blank">Dynamo</a>-like database into an eventually consistent\u000a<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAP_theorem" target="_blank">AP</a> log and a key-value serving layer. Such a log\u000ais a bit tricky to work with, as it will redeliver old messages and\u000adepends on the subscriber to handle this (much like Dynamo itself). </p>\u000a<p> The idea of having a separate copy of data in the log (especially if\u000ait is a complete copy) strikes many people as wasteful. In reality,\u000athough there are a few factors that make this less of an issue. First,\u000athe log can be a particularly efficient storage mechanism. We store\u000aover 75TB per datacenter on our production Kafka servers. Meanwhile\u000amany serving systems require much more memory to serve data\u000aefficiently (text search, for example, is often all in memory). The\u000aserving system may also use optimized hardware. For example, most our\u000alive data systems either serve out of memory or else use SSDs. In\u000acontrast, the log system does only linear reads and writes, so it is\u000aquite happy using large multi-TB hard drives. Finally, as in the\u000apicture above, in the case where the data is served by multiple\u000asystems, the cost of the log is amortized over multiple indexes. This\u000acombination makes the expense of an external log pretty minimal. </p>\u000a<p> This is exactly the pattern that LinkedIn has used to build out many\u000aof its own real-time query systems. These systems feed off a database\u000a(using Databus as a log abstraction or off a dedicated log from Kafka)\u000aand provide a particular partitioning, indexing, and query capability\u000aon top of that data stream. This is the way we have implemented our\u000asearch, social graph, and OLAP query systems. In fact, it is quite\u000acommon to have a single data feed (whether a live feed or a derived\u000afeed coming from Hadoop) replicated into multiple serving systems for\u000alive serving. This has proven to be an enormous simplifying\u000aassumption. None of these systems need to have an externally\u000aaccessible write api at all, Kafka and databases are used as the\u000asystem of record and changes flow to the appropriate query systems\u000athrough that log. Writes are handled locally by the nodes hosting a\u000aparticular partition. These nodes blindly transcribe the feed provided\u000aby the log to their own store. A failed node can be restored by\u000areplaying the upstream log. </p>\u000a<p> The degree to which these systems rely on the log varies. A fully\u000areliant system could make use of the log for data partitioning, node\u000arestore, rebalancing, and all aspects of consistency and data\u000apropagation. In this setup, the actual serving tier is actually\u000anothing less than a sort of &quot;cache&quot; structured to enable a\u000aparticular type of processing with writes going directly to the log. </p>\u000a<h2>The End</h2>\u000a<p> If you made it this far you know most of what I know about logs. </p>\u000a<p> Here are a few interesting references you may want to check out. </p>\u000a<p> Everyone seems to uses different terms for the same things so it is\u000aa bit of a puzzle to connect the database literature to the\u000adistributed systems stuff to the various enterprise software camps to\u000athe open source world.

This\u000aapproach to application development seems to combine the\u000a&quot;stream processing&quot; that occurs on the log of events with\u000athe application.
